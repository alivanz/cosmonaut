# Learn C the Ã¼ber hard way

## Description

Fast multithreaded web server written in C. Just for fun.

### Lifecycle

#### Bind to port
#### Accept request & fork
#### Do clean-up

## Interesting things

### Fork a process

Fork returns new process pid into new process and 0 to parent process thus everything inside `if` block would be executed in a new process. Don't forget to call `exit(0)` to prevent accidental fall-trough.

    if (!fork()) {
      do_something();
      exit(0);
    }

### Signals

`signal` is outdated - use `sigaction` instead. Set a function to catch & process signals.
