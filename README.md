# Learn C the Ã¼ber hard way

## Description

Fast multithreaded web server written in C. Just for fun.

### Lifecycle

#### Bind to port
#### Accept request & fork
#### Do clean-up

## Interesting things

### Project structure

This is very very very important because the later you realize that your project structure is full of shit the harder it would be to do it in a right way. Use make, don't try to use rake for a C project. It doesn't work. (At least for me it didn't)

### Fork a process

Fork returns new process pid into new process and 0 to parent process thus everything inside `if` block would be executed in a new process. Don't forget to call `exit(0)` to prevent accidental fall-through.

    if (!fork()) {
      do_something();
      exit(0);
    }

### Signals

`signal` is outdated - use `sigaction` instead. Set a function to catch & process signals.

### Signals & global variables

Use `sig_atomic_t` type to prevent firing signal handler callback in the middle of the read.

### Accept connection

`accept` - gets connection from queue and returns new socket file descriptor for it.

* http://linux.die.net/man/2/accept

### Cool trick to eliminate useless variables

    int yes = 1;
    setsockopt(server_socket_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, (&yes, sizeof(int)) == -1)

vs.

    setsockopt(server_socket_fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, (int[]){1}, sizeof(int))

### Configuration parsing

Ini-format file parser.
